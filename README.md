A web programme called the Online Flight Reservation System enables commuters to make online flight reservations. The commuter must fill out a registration form in order to book a ticket. The user must log in after creating an account on his own to purchase a ticket. The user must identify the destinations he will be visiting and the airline(s) he will be flying with when making a reservation. The system will give information on flights and venues that are available on the date that the commuter specifies, depending on the type of airline and location. After purchasing the ticket, commuters can view the reservation. The commuter will be able to see information about his reservation. The System will give passengers information on the flight.
The administrator of the online flight reservation system can view the reservations made by the passengers and can add any pertinent flight-related notices.
